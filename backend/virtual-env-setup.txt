1. cd into /backend and run this
    python -m venv <name of your virtual environment>
2. run this to activate the virtual environment
    ./<name of your virtual environment>/Scripts/activate
    Note activating the virtual environment might be different if you are on linux
3. run this to install the needed packages to the venv
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    Note: be in the same folder as the requirements.txt file and make sure the virtual environment is active
4. add the path to your virtual in the .gitignore file at the root folder of the repository
    This is so your virtual environment will not be pushed to the github repo
    
Whenever a new package is installed update the requirements.txt file. Everyone can update their
own virtual environment by using this file
